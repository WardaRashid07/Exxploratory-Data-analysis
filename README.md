# Cardiovascular Disease Dataset Analysis
This project explores and analyzes the Cardiovascular Disease dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that can help understand the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

## 📁 Dataset Information
The dataset includes medical records of patients with the following features:

Demographic: age, gender, height, weight

Clinical: ap_hi (systolic BP), ap_lo (diastolic BP), cholesterol, gluc (glucose)

Lifestyle: smoke, alco, active

Target: cardio (0 = No disease, 1 = Has cardiovascular disease)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis covers:

✅ Gender-wise distribution of cardiovascular patients

✅ Cholesterol & glucose level breakdown

✅ Histograms with KDE plots for health features

✅ Correlation heatmap to detect relationships between variables

✅ Basic statistics: mean, median, mode, skewness, kurtosis


## 📈 Sample Visualizations
Bar plots for gender-based cardio prevalence

KDE plots for cholesterol and glucose levels

Correlation heatmap for all features

## 💡 Insights
Skewness and kurtosis reveal distribution shape and outliers.

Cholesterol and glucose levels are strongly associated with cardiovascular disease in the dataset.
